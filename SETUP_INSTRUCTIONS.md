# Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup for GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it: `sp500-lstm-portfolio`
   - Make it public (for portfolio visibility)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Upload the project**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: S&P 500 LSTM Portfolio Selection System"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sp500-lstm-portfolio.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Update personal information**
   - Edit `README.md`: Replace "Your Name" with your actual name
   - Edit `LICENSE`: Replace "[Your Name]" with your actual name
   - Update contact information in README
   - Update LinkedIn and email links

## Running the Project

### Option 1: Modular Version (Recommended)
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the main script
python main.py
```

### Option 2: Standalone Version
```bash
# For Google Colab or Jupyter
python lstm_stock_selection_standalone.py
```

### Option 3: In Jupyter Notebook
- Copy code from `lstm_stock_selection_standalone.py` to notebook cells
- Run cells sequentially

## Project Highlights for Resume/LinkedIn

### Technical Skills Demonstrated

üöÄ Just built something cool: S&P 500 Stock Selection using LSTM Neural Networks!

As a Stats & Econ student at UTSC, I wanted to see if deep learning could beat traditional portfolio strategies. Spoiler: it's complicated but fascinating!

üìä What I built:
‚Ä¢ Analyzes ALL 500+ S&P stocks using LSTM models
‚Ä¢ Predicts future returns using 10 years of historical data  
‚Ä¢ Backtests against market benchmarks
‚Ä¢ Risk-adjusted metrics (because returns without risk = gambling!)

üí° Key insight: Combining statistical knowledge with ML creates powerful financial models

## Customization Tips

1. **Improve Performance**
   - Increase `EPOCHS` in config (currently 3 for speed)
   - Add more LSTM layers or units
   - Include technical indicators as features
   - Implement ensemble models

2. **Add Features**
   - Sentiment analysis from news
   - Fundamental data integration
   - Real-time trading signals
   - Web dashboard using Streamlit/Dash

3. **Portfolio Strategies**
   - Mean-variance optimization
   - Risk parity
   - Maximum Sharpe ratio
   - Minimum volatility

## Interview Talking Points

1. **Problem Statement**: "As a Stats & Econ student, I wanted to bridge the gap between theoretical models we learn in class and practical applications. Traditional portfolio selection often misses complex patterns that deep learning can capture."

2. **Technical Challenges**: 
   - "Processing 500+ stocks with 10 years of data taught me about computational efficiency"
   - "Balancing model complexity with interpretability - important for financial applications"
   - "Preventing overfitting using proper time series validation techniques from my STAT courses"

3. **Interdisciplinary Approach**: "My economics background helped me understand market dynamics, while statistics gave me the tools to quantify risk properly. Combining this with deep learning created a unique perspective."

4. **Results & Learning**: "Beyond the performance metrics, this project taught me how academic concepts translate to real-world problems. It's like applying game theory to markets - strategic thinking meets data science!"

5. **Future Vision**: "I'm exploring how to incorporate behavioral economics insights and alternative data sources. Also interested in applying similar techniques to the Toronto housing market (another project I'm working on!)"
